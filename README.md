![Adopted](https://i.imgur.com/ymmZJ2Z.png)

CyptoNow is a mobile friendly, self updating site that brings current prices of all major coins on the market to your doorstep. This app was to address the main problem of cryptocurrency monitoring (a highly volatile market), and that most site rely on the user actively nagivating through the site to provide 'refreshes to the page'. CryptoNow updates every 2 minutes to provide the most current prices available in order for you to make decisions on your coins. In addition, the app marks coins that are mineable, should you choose to investigate further :)
CryptoNow also provides ease of usability for the users, favorite your stocks and view them all in one place, with prices updating every 2 minutes.

#Unsolved Problems

* **Watchlist Page** - i had an unknown bug that necessitated a rolback, so this component is no longer working, but it will be back up as soon as i reprogram the component.

#Future Enhancements

* **Server side program running to store Coin data** - create a program to run server side to fetch the price of the coin data from each stock at 8pm and then store in the database(to allow graphing of th data)

* **Graph stock data history** - reference above :)


* **Share News Articles** - Share articles with friends via nodemailer
